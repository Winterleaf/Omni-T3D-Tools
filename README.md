# Omni-T3D-Tools
Omni T3D Tools


!!!IMPORTANT!!!

This solution requires the Visual Studio 2010 SDK, "VsSDK_sfx.exe".

Also, this is a Visual Studio 2010 solution.  
It is built in 2010 so that the tools will work in Visual Studio 2010 and newer.
If you upgrade it to 2013 or 2015, the tools will no longer work in Visual Studio 2010.
